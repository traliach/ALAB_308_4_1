## ALAB 308.4.1 – Working with Data Collections (JS)

lab to practice working with CSV data using arrays and objects.


### What the code does

- **Part 1**: Parse a CSV string into a 2D `rows` array and show it with `console.table(rows)`.
- **Part 2**: Use the first row as headers, build a clean `table` with the right number of columns.
- **Part 3**: Turn each data row into an object (array of `people`), keys are lowercase header names.
- **Part 4**: Change the `people` list (remove last, add Barry and Bilbo) and calculate the average age with a loop.
- **Part 5**: Turn the final `people` array back into a CSV string and print it.
